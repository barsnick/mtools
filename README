Original code (versions through 2.0.7?) by Emmet P. Gray (Texas, USA), who
no longer appears to be reachable by Internet e-mail.  Viktor Dukhovni (at
Princeton, USA) had major input into v2.0.

Since 2.0.7: maintained primarily and until now informally by Alain
Knaff (Grenoble, France) and David Niemi (Reston, Virginia, USA).

Please report bugs to <Alain.Knaff@inrialpes.fr> and cc

Bugs/TODO
---------

1) Address default case of non-VFAT files:
   Perhaps case flags of 0/0 should mean "all lowercase" and 1/1
   "all uppercase", so that default files == 0/0 and 1/1 == unusual case
   0/1 still means upper/lower and 1/0 still means lower/upper.
   Perhaps also have a "strict case" option to force the current behavior.

2) Man pages and documentation are doubtless badly out of date

3) Recognize and cleanly ignore "Class" entries (or even obey them???)
