Installation of mtools is now pretty straightforward:

  1. Run ./configure
  2. Run make

 Configuration options:

  * Use ./configure --enable-vold to compile mtools to use Solaris'
vold instead of directly accessing the floppy disk
  * Use ./configure --disable-xdf to disable support for Xdf disks on Linux
